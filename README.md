# KNN-Classification
With a focus on KNN Algorithm, this project aims to
comparative analysis using two distinct datasets i.e., heart disease and diabetes. I have used four normalization techniques: min-max Scaler, Standard Scaler, Maximum absolute Scaler, and Robust Scaler. With proper preprocessing
model has been compared based on the performance.KNN has been proven to be one of the best that obtain the
highest accuracy for both datasets.
